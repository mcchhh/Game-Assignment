Final Game Project - Michelle Beth Teo 

Hi, I hope you have fun playing my game project. I encourage you to find all the potions in the game before finding the flag to win the game!

In the beginning, everything was easily understandable. I was able to code and implement my game character, trees, canyons, clouds, and collectables easily. However, when it came to array, for loops, and functions part, I had a few struggles trying to understand how it works and how it can be implemented in this game project. I hope I was able to deliver it properly throughout this project, with the help of the professors, Coursera videos, student community and self-research. 

Some good skills I have learnt was implementing platforms (add difficulty in the game), changing the background to have a gradient (visual aspect) and to refractor my codes as having all codes on one JavaScript page can be very long and messy, hence to refractor it and to add comments along the way has helped me navigate my codes around easily without being lost. 

In all, programming this game project has helped me have a better understanding and learning towards JavaScript as a whole. Although I may not be good at it yet, it makes me want to continue learning and to improve my skills along the way. Thank you.
